# lets go redux!

## Usage

1. Copy this repo.
2. `cd` into this folder and `npm install`.

I also encourage you to use an editor that supports inline linting like Atom.
To make use of this, install the `linter` and `linter-eslint` packages for it.

I added some linting rules, overwrite them if you feel the need to. I just found some linting rules to be annoying.
